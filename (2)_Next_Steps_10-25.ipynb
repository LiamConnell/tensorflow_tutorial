    "After the previous presentation we hopefully have a basic understanding of the idea of a tensor and how it is different from data objects in other python/R librarys. We also understand three types of tensors (Constant, Placeholder, Variable) and their properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "To reinforce this, I'll provide some definitions from the TensorFlow website's \"Programmer's Guide\":\n",
    "\n",
    "* TensorFlow programs work by first building a graph of `tf.Tensor` objects, detailing how each tensor is computed based on the other available tensors and then by running parts of this graph to achieve the desired results.\n",
    "* A **`tf.Tensor`** object represents a partially defined computation that will eventually produce a value. \n",
    "    + It has properties: \n",
    "        - data type (float32, int32, or string, for example)  \n",
    "        - shape (the number of dimensions it has and the size of each dimension) \n",
    "    + The data type must be defined and consistent across elements, but the shape might be only partially known\n",
    "* A `tf.placeholder` object is passed data at runtime, usually as \"input\" and \"target\" dat\n",
    "* A `tf.Variable` is defined with the function `tf.get_variable(\"name\", shape, [dtype=implied, initializer=glorot_uniform_initializer, trainable=TRUE, collections=])`\n",
    "    + must be initialized before runtime, usually with `tf.global_variables_initializer()`\n",
    "    + in the future we will see: can be placed in a specific device, `tf.variable_scope` used for reusing variables defined in functions\n",
    "    \n",
    "Furthermore, we defined the three modules that will be defined in all of our ML projects: Model, Loss Function, Optimizer"
